# WordPress User Integration Plan

## Frontend Implementation Plan

### 1. Authentication System
- Implement JWT-based authentication using WordPress JWT plugin
- Create centralized auth context for managing user state
- Handle token storage and refresh mechanism
- Implement protected routes and middleware

### 2. Required Components
- Login form (`/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`)
- Registration form (`/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx`)
- Profile management (`/src/components/profile/ProfileManager.tsx`)
- Password reset flow (`/src/components/auth/PasswordReset.tsx`)

### 3. API Integration (`/src/lib/api/authApi.ts`)
```typescript
interface AuthAPI {
  login(username: string, password: string): Promise<AuthResponse>;
  register(userData: UserRegistrationData): Promise<AuthResponse>;
  resetPassword(email: string): Promise<void>;
  updateProfile(userData: UserUpdateData): Promise<User>;
  getProfile(): Promise<User>;
}
```

### 4. Data Flow
1. User authentication state stored in React Context
2. Protected routes check auth state via middleware
3. API calls include JWT token in headers
4. Token refresh handled automatically

### 5. Required Pages
- `/auth/login` - Login page
- `/auth/register` - Registration page
- `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset
- `/profile` - User profile management

### 6. Security Considerations
- Implement CSRF protection
- Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### 7. User Experience
- Loading states for all auth actions
- Clear error messages
- Redirect handling post-auth
- Remember me functionality
- Social login integration (optional)
